Similar to the [Hactoberfest'21](https://vinitshahdeo.dev/hacktoberfest-2021) initiative, we're planning another community-led open-source initiative for helping the community level up their JavaScript coding skills by solving a non-trivial problem daily. None of the questions will be tricks ‚îÅ you don‚Äôt have to worry about handling big integers or knowing how to balance a red-black tree. Every problem will be based on what you do on a daily basis as a JavaScript developer.
